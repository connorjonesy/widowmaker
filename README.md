# Widowmaker Chess Engine

Widowmaker is a hobby chess engine written in C by me.

I got loads of information on how to program chess thanks to chessprogramming.org.

I learned all about Magic Bitboards and why they are helpful here ~ analog-hors.github.io/site/magic-bitboards

Widowmaker is a work in progress.
